# Cricket Data Performance Dashboard (05/2022 - 05/2022)

In this project, I aimed to build a performance dashboard for cricket players using data obtained from ESPN Cricinfo. The project was completed over a period of one month, from May 2022 to May 2022.

To start, I utilized web scraping techniques to extract cricket data from the ESPN Cricinfo website. I used the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to perform this task. Once the data was extracted, I performed data cleaning and organization, storing the data in Excel files for later use.

Next, I used MS Power Bi to create a comprehensive performance dashboard that provides insights into the performance of various cricket players. I utilized my skills in data visualization to design an intuitive and interactive dashboard that allows users to quickly and easily compare player performance.

In addition to my technical skills, I also utilized my experience in web scraping and data visualization to deliver a high-quality and visually appealing dashboard. The final result was a valuable tool that helps users understand and analyze cricket player performance.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to apply my skills in web scraping and data visualization to a real-world problem. I am confident that the knowledge and experience gained from this project will be useful in my future endeavors.
