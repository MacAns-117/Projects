# Predicting House Price Using Advanced Ensemble Techniques (10/2020 - 12/2021)

This project is about predicting house price in cities of India. This project was completed as part of final year of Master of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering degree. The goal of this project was to develop an accurate and reliable model to predict the house prices in various cities across India. The data was collected from Kaggle and consisted of 29451 observations, with 12 explanatory variables that describe different aspects of residential homes. To achieve this, I utilized advanced ensemble techniques, including stacking, blending, and bagging, to enhance the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms.

The project was completed over a period of 14 months, from October 2020 to December 2021. During this time, I used a variety of libraries and tools, including Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Folium, Streamlit, and Pycaret, to perform data cleaning, analysis, and modeling. I also utilized VS Code as my primary development environment to write and test my code.

In addition to the technical skills required for this project, I also utilized my expertise in data analysis and machine learning to clean, transform, and visualize the data. The final result was a highly accurate and robust model that can predict house prices with high accuracy.

Overall, this project allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of ensemble techniques, as well as to apply my skills in data analysis and machine learning to a real-world problem. I am confident that the insights and knowledge gained from this project will be useful in my future endeavors.
