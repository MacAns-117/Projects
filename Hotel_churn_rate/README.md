# Hotel Churn Rate (06/2022 - 07/2022)

In this project, I was part of a data science event hosted by Lizefly, where the objective was to predict hotel churn rate by analyzing booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel. The project was completed over a period of two months, from June 2022 to July 2022.

I was given a dataset containing more than 1 Lakh booking details, which included information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, number of adults, children, and babies, and the number of parking spaces. Some information was anonymized for privacy reasons.

To analyze the data, I used a variety of libraries, including Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Missingno. These libraries allowed me to clean the data, perform data modeling, and conduct data analysis.

I also used machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a customer is likely to cancel a hotel or resort booking. The model was built and trained using the data I had cleaned and analyzed, and the final result was a highly accurate predictive tool.

In conclusion, this project was a great opportunity for me to apply my skills in data cleaning, data modeling, data analysis, and machine learning to a real-world problem. I am confident that the knowledge and experience gained from this project will be useful in my future endeavors.
