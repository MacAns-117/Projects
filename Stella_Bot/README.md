# Stella Bot - A Voice Interaction Virtual Assistant

In this project, I developed a cutting-edge virtual assistant, Stella Bot, capable of voice interaction. With its advanced capabilities, this rule-based bot is able to perform a range of functions, from telling jokes to opening websites such as Github, Google Search, Youtube, Facebook, and even programs like VS Code. This project showcases my expertise in Python programming, and demonstrates my ability to create innovative and practical solutions for real-world problems. The development of Stella Bot was a challenging and rewarding experience that has allowed me to further hone my skills in the field of programming.
