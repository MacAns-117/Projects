# Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization (12/2022 - 12/2022)


In this Virtual Experience I am working as a Data Analyst at Accenture. As a Data Analyst at Accenture, I was part of a dynamic team working on a new project for a client named Social Buzz. Our goal was to help the client understand the impact of their social media presence on their business. To achieve this, I was tasked with gathering requirements, cleaning data, and creating a comprehensive data model to support our analysis and visualization efforts.

The project was completed over a period of one month, from December 2022 to December 2022. During this time, I utilized my expertise in data analysis and visualization to help our team deliver valuable insights to the client. I used MS Power Bi and MS Excel to perform data cleaning, modeling, and visualization tasks.

My role involved taking raw data and transforming it into meaningful information through data cleaning, data modeling, and data visualization. The final result was a comprehensive data dashboard that provided insights into the impact of Social Buzz's social media presence on their business. This helped the client make informed decisions and drive growth.

In conclusion, this virtual experience allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of data analytics and visualization, and to apply my skills to a real-world problem. I am confident that the knowledge and experience gained from this project will be useful in my future endeavors.
